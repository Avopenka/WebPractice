# View the page

Open the file `Basics/index.html` in a Web browser.  

The HTML file defines the content, the test and images and other media.  

The file `style.css` changes the appearance of the content. It controls fonts, colours, 
font sizes and positioning on the page.

# HTML

HTML has elements, sometimes called tags. They are enclosed in angle brackets.
Each tag has a closing tag which starts `</`. For example `<H1>Heading</h1>`.
The tags are not case sensitive so `<h1>` and `<H1>` are equivalent.
Some tags are self closing and take the form `<br/>`.

# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are included in HTML documents. Styles can go in the HTML 
`<head>` tag or preferably in a linked external file.  

The simplest CSS styles are applied to a particular tag. Styles applied to `body` are the
global defaults. They can be overriden by styles for more specific tags. A tag style takes
the form `body { ... }`. Each style can have multiple entries of the form `color: red;`.
Colours can be either names like `red` or RGB codes like `#ff0000`.
